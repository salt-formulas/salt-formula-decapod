"""This module contains implementation of authorization for Decapod API.

Decapod client uses `requests
<http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/>`_ library
to access its API so authentication is done using
requests's classes. Please check `official guide
<http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#custom-authentication>`_
for details.
